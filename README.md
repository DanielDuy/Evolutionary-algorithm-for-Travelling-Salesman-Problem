# Evolutionary-algorithm-for-Travelling-Salesman-Problem
- Here I go into comparing Exhaustive search, Hill climbing and Evolutionary Algorithm to solve the Travelling Salesman Problem.
- My choice of crossover and mutation for the Evolutionary Algorithm:
  - Swap mutation, where every gene has a chance to swap with another gene.
  - Partially mapped Crossover, because it partially conserve the neighbor relationship which is the important for this problem.
